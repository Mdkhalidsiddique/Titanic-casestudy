Random sample imputation:

AIM- It replaces the missing values with random values from the dataset.
Assumption- It assumes that the data is missing completly at random.
Advantages:
1. Easy to implement.
2. Variance is less distorted.
Disadvantages:
1. Randomness won't work in every situation.

Capturing NAN with new feature:

Assumption- It assumes that the data is not missing completly at random.
Advantages:
1. Easy to implement.
2. Captures the importance of NAN values.
Disadvantages:
1.  Creates additional features which leads to curse of dimensionality.

End of distribution imputation:

Assumption: It assumes that the data is not missing completly as random.
Advantages:
1. Easy to implement.
2. Captures the importance of NAN values.
Disadvantages:
1. Distortes the variance.
